# Bayesian Neural Networks for Regression in NumPyro
Joshua Simmons - DARE - 10/2023

This notebook demonstrates how to implement a Bayesian Neural Network in NumPyro, both directly and with flax. The code builds on the NumPyro BNN example (https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/examples/bnn.html) to give some sample code for MCMC sampling and SVI, to demonstrate the use of BNNs in NumPyro.

Requirements: numpyro, flax, arviz, seaborn
